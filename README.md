Overview
This project sets up a basic AWS infrastructure using Terraform, including a VPC, Lambda function, API Gateway, CloudFront distribution, and WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules. The Lambda function responds to API Gateway requests with a "Hello World" message. WAF is integrated with CloudFront to add a layer of security to the API.
